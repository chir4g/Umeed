# Umeed : Platform to fight hate speech cyber bullying child predators and explicit content explorers.

Umeed is a platform developed by Team-BlackNet to help combat the perpatrators on the Social Media and safe guard our children.

The problem in today's age of never ending information is that our parents and guardians are the generations not well equipped with tools to save their children from bad elements of society. Parents and Guardians can deal with in person contacts and move their children through the real life landscapes but on digital platforms they are helpless. First of all majority of families living below the higher middle class are not well versed with the uses of social media and even if some are they are not actively able to help their kids since the flow of information is so fast that they cannot focus on any one aspect.

Our platform serves as tool to empower parents and guardian which can help them actively monitor their children's public domain activities and help them find out whether any kind of bad influence is near them.

Our platform tackles three main issues:
* Cyber-Bullying : Our platform is actively able to label the text classified as Cyber Bullying, whether your kid is the victim or the perpatrator this tool is able to notify parents and they can take the right step, which in most of the cases means counselling. This allows parents to never let situation get out of hand, they can counsel and guide their children to be more empathetic, understanding and in case of victim they can take the necessary actions both legal and social.

* Child Predators : Child Predators in India are at all time high, unfortunately we have still not protected our children online. It is said in India every fifth children can be a prey of child abuse by 2030 if not paid attention to. The definition of predators is still very vague and legal challengable that's why we have discarded all of the biased and opinion based algorithms and only used the most concerte techniques by consulting to highlight the parts where we suspect not imply.

* Explicit Content : By Scanning profile our another trained algorithm is able to tell whether the content being shared is explicit or not.
